The main aim of the event was to increase the understanding of Computer Science and prove that it is possible to introduce programming using Code.org. Our team conducted the Hour Of Code event in which 20 students from 7th grade actively participated, solved various assignments, and received certificates.</strong></p>

                            On November 6th, our team conducted an Hour of Code event at the secondary gymnasium named after N. Tusi. Despite challenges such as a lack of equipment, we engaged approximately 20 seventh-grade students, introducing them to programming concepts. The students showed keen interest in ADA University, asking questions about our majors and exchange programs. Ayla Ismayilzada initiated the lesson, explaining algorithms and guiding students through https://studio.code.org/hoc/1. Despite limited resources, we ensured each student had a chance to complete the maze set, providing individual assistance. The interactive session sparked curiosity, and students were awarded certificates and ADA University stickers. We extended the session to address students' questions, finding that the experience was a departure from their usual informatics classes. The positive reception led to a recommendation to the teacher to incorporate interactive games in her teaching. Our team also participated in the Victory Day event and discussed the preparation process and challenges faced. We appreciate the support of Professor Araz and Ismayil Muallim in introducing us to Code.org and organizing this enriching event, enhancing our programming skills and fostering teamwork and communication.
