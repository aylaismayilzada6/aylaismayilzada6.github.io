             <p><strong>Thanks to ADA University, I am now at level two of my academic journey with three more exciting years to complete. 
                I finished the EAPP program last year, and this semester opened up the doors of computer science major. When I entered high school, I set several goals for myself, and one of them was to ("survive") overcome all the problems that university will create for me and ultimately become a leading member of our society. I have several hobbies, such as playing billiards üé±, watching movies üçø and swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÇ.</strong></p>
